I can
understand how this image could be closer to lighthouse as some of the rocks could have a
similar hue as the initial lighthouse picture, but for the butterfly I can not understand why the
model is saying it is 40% similar.Ryan Smith

Selected tool URL:After learning
more about these advanced options I have increased my epochs to 1000 and kept both batch size
and learning rate on their defaults.
Image comparison:
When I uploaded a different image of a butterfly, we can observe that the computer is able to
distinguish that the image is more of a butterfly than a lighthouse, but not by a huge margin.Furthermore, each of the classes
allow for more than one image to be input, I assume adding additional images into the class will
help train the model further and improve accuracy when comparing images.I can upload an image into each of the
classes with class one being a picture of a butterfly and class two being a picture of a lighthouse.
For instance, if I
added my second butterfly picture to the butterfly class, I wonder if the computer would be able
to more accurately differentiate between a third butterfly and the lighthouse.Gathering the classes:
Teachable Machine allows the user to capture images via webcam or upload images downloaded
on the local device and store then into two separate classes.The following image displays a better percentage (57%), which is a decent result as this is
close to 3/5th but not by any means definite and that our model can be trained further for better
results.The website informs the user that if we provided
80 images the data would be split into 80 / 16 = 5 batches and once 5 batches have been put
through the model, one epoch will be completed.As this
is a close margin, we can assume that the image input has a large influence of the percentage
different such as the position of the butterfly in the picture, or the color of the butterfly.Finally, we have
learning rate and the website provides a note to be extremely careful when adjusting this number
(0.001), as small differences can have huge effects on how the model will learn.After the
examples have been gathered, the user is able to train the model and immediately test it to see if
it can correctly classify new examples.Training the classes:
Teachable Machine makes training the classes created very simple but doing this manually could
prove to be a very time consuming and tedious process.Increasing the epochs will generally help
the model learn to predict the data and is a good idea to change the epochs until a desired result
is accomplished.Interesting aspects:
Something interesting about Teachable Machine that I did not get around to attempting as adding
additional classes to train a model with.When I upload the pictures, we will be able to see if the model is
taught enough to see the difference between these two new images.
As I previously stated, this model can be trained more strictly
in order to come out with better results and be more exact in the comparison.
Although this seems very
useful, it is extremely difficult as shown above where with some test training we input one type
of butterfly and compared it with another and nearly did not get a 50%+ match.As for training the
model, I will be using the default settings first and adjust them accordingly to see the differences.
Preview:
The final section of Teachable Machine is the preview part, and this allows the user to compare
input pictures uploaded from a local device or taken through a webcam.Why is this tool relevant?
A more refined version of this tool would be used for government use, as it allows for a good
facial recognition software.Another aspect of
Teachable Machine is the audio project, since the website explains that is possible to teach the
computer the difference between two genres.This type of
artificial intelligence can prove extremely beneficial as it can provide our society with more
security.The results in the following image are very interesting as
this image is closer to the initial lighthouse than the previously tested lighthouse image.Our
trained model is saying that this new image chosen is 52% like the first class (butterfly).As previously stated, we will move onto the training model portion of the website, which will
allow me to train the computer to recognize each of these pictures separately.Although, this website provides us with
a “Train Model” button after inputting settings such as epochs, batch size and learning rate.For example, in the previous picture I had put the epochs to 50 (default), this means that the
model will work through the training dataset 50 times.This website can gather information input by the
user and group the examples into classes or categories for the computer to learn.Epochs means that each of the classes have been put through the training model at least one time.
Lastly, I will be comparing an outlier image of pebbles with a small plant to see which the
trained model will lean more towards.The user can use previously downloaded files or take
live pictures for our model.In order to demonstrate
this section, I found more images to see how training my model went.Continuing onward we can test our lighthouse class in a similar fashion by choosing a different
image.I gathered an additional
butterfly and lighthouse image.If a model is trained extremely efficiently, we could make a security system that
when armed could detect if an unknown person enters the building.The contents of these classes will be
how we train our computer to recognize similar images.From my understanding I can add many more classes
which can help narrow down an input image when previewing.The website also informs the user that this
number will typically not need to be modified to get good training results.The image below shows the types of files or images Teachable
Machine can use.Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that can create machine learning
models fast, easy, and accessible to every user.This website interested me the most as it utilizes machine learning and recognition models used
by the computer.Finally, Teachable Machine can export the model creates
for projects, sites, apps, and download or host it online.Another setting is batch size with the default being 16, and a bath is a set of
samples used in a singular iteration of training.Teachable Machine is extremely flexible
about what can be taught to the computer.Another application for everyday commercial use would be a home
security system.The tool I selected for project four of Intro to Artificial Intelligence is the Teachable Machine.
This feature is something I expect to test further in
the future.https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/
